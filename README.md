# [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/)

## Introduction

The gist of the challenge is as follows: given a binary file
([challenge.bin](./challenge.bin)), use the architecture spec
([arch-spec](./arch-spec)) provided to create a virtual machine to run the
included binary and solve the puzzles within. Along the way, codes can be
found which can be submitted to the challenge
[website](https://challenge.synacor.com/) to track your progress.

## Solutions

I have included a short guide describing the steps required to obtain
each code, which can be found in the **solutions** directory, or by clicking
this [link](./solutions/guide.md)

## Trying it out

If you have Python 3.6 or above installed, you can try running the binary and
have fun solving the puzzles yourself!

Just clone this repository, then do the following at the root directory:
```shell
$ ./main.py
```
